### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Viorel Robu

I'm a self taught php developer and I love Laravel. :heart:
I began my coding journey about 2 years ago when, at my former job, there was a need for custom software. At that time, the department where I worked at was using Excel instead of a database and believe me, it was a pain to keep everything up to date and provide accurate reports when required.
I didn't write this software from the scratch myself, rather it was a contracted developer (at first I was the Project Manager from my company side). Later I started to do some bugfixing and adding new features (the software maintenance was also done by me) and this continued until august 2021 when I switched gears and became a full-time Software Development Engineer at my current company!

Other software custom made by me for my former company:
- [Timber Reception](https://github.com/ViorelRobu/timber_reception) - a software to keep track of timber orders, deliveries and claims (plus some other features)
- [Orders](https://github.com/ViorelRobu/orders) - a software to ease production planning at our factory

You can find some other small projects in my profile. Feel free to look over them.

Best regards!
