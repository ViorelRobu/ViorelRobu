### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Viorel Robu

I'm a self taught php developer and I love Laravel. :heart:
I began my coding journey about 2 years ago when, at the place I currently work, there was a need for custom software. At that time we were using Excel instead of a database and believe me, it was a pain to keep everything up to date.
I didn't write this software from the scratch myself, rather it was a contracted developer. Later I started to do some bugfixing and adding new features. Now I can proudly say:
> A big part of this is my work. :smirk:

The software is still being actively developed and additional features are added regularly (mostly by me).

After that I developed other 2 applications to ease my work:
- [Timber Reception](https://github.com/ViorelRobu/timber_reception) - a software to keep track of timber orders, deliveries and claims (plus some other features)
- [Orders](https://github.com/ViorelRobu/orders) - a software to ease production planning at our factory

You can find some other small projects in my profile. Feel free to look over them.

I know that I still have a long way to go and I keep on learning. 🌱
